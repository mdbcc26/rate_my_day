App Concept
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our app started as one of our projects for our Mobile Coding course. The initial app was a bare-bones mood tracker. Users were able to rate their days on a scale of 1-5 stars and see an overview of their rated days throughout the months. Our use case was people wanting to have a nice, clean and simple overview of their mood 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting out
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We had some initial ideas for what we wanted to add to our app however started with a formative user test to determine what people in general would use the app for and what they would expect. The two major features highlighted were the ability to add comments to each day, allowing them to keep better track of why each day got that rating and were not happy with the default and at the time only color palette. We decided these would be our two main additions to the app, comments and changing color themes. Some users pointed out small changes that should be made for quality of life, visibility of information and overall ease of use that were added to our list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Test
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The User-testing was done in three rounds, the first two of which were formative studies, conducted by a group of our peers, talking through their likes, dislikes, suggestions, personal grievances and any improvements. This data was used alongside development and fine tuning the app. The final round of user-testing was summative, involving a SEQ (Single-Easy-Question) and UEQ (User experience questionnaire) design in order to gain some insight into how users rated our app and what they value in such an app.

Database and Preference structure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rate My Day uses both Room and DataStore as database infrastructures.
- Room is used to store all data about each rated day.
- DataStore is used to check what theme and mode is currently being used.
